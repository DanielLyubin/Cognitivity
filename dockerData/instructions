- execute command: sudo docker build -t database .
  this command will build the image of the docker from the Dockerfile

- execute command: sudo docker run -d --name database -p3306:3306 database
  this command will run the image, and will redrict port 3306 of the docker to
  port 3306 of the computer, you can add the flag -d so the docker will run in background

- execute command: sudo docker exec -it database bash

    if there's an error, wait and try again
