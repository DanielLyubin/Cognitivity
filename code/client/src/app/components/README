Convention for adding components:
~Assuming you have angular-cli dependency installed~
In console, use the following command 'ng g component components/component-name'
(component-name needs to be short)

The command will generate a folder named 'component-name' and will include 4 files:
-component-name.html
-component-name.css
-component-name.ts
-component-name.spec.ts

GUI/view-html,css
Controller-.ts file
TESTING- spec.ts file
